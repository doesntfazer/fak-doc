# Getting started

We have now moved to user configuration repositories: [fak-config](https://github.com/semickolon/fak-config). Refer to `fak-config` on how to get started and build keyboards with FAK. You will also find full keyboard and keymap example definitions there.

This repo is for the development of FAK firmware itself where the core functionality and features are implemented.
